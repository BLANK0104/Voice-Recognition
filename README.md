## 🌟 Project Overview

The **Voice Recognition System** addresses the critical challenge of cybercrime investigation where fraudsters use voice communication (GSM/VoIP calls) to deceive victims. This system empowers law enforcement with state-of-the-art tools to:

- **Analyze** voice samples with AI-powered algorithms
- **Store** forensic evidence with proper chain of custody
- **Match** suspects against existing voice databases
- **Generate** court-admissible evidence reports

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Many cyber frauds occur through voice communication where victims can record fraudster voices. However, these recordings often contain noise and distortions. This system processes these imperfect voice samples to create reliable voice fingerprints for criminal identification.
